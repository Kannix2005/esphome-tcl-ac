# ESPHome TCL AC Component

Custom ESPHome component for controlling TCL air conditioners via UART (Realtek RTL8710C WiFi module protocol).

## Features

✅ **Complete Protocol Implementation** (validated from real UART logs)
- All climate modes: Cool, Heat, Dry, Fan, Auto
- Fan speeds: Auto, Low, Medium, High (with Quiet and Turbo presets)
- Temperature control: 16°C - 32°C
- Swing control: Vertical, Horizontal, Both
- Special modes: ECO, Turbo (Boost), Quiet (Comfort), Sleep, Health
- Display and Beeper control

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP8266 or ESP32 board
- TCL AC unit with Realtek RTL8710C WiFi module
- UART connection to the AC (9600 baud, 8E1)

### UART Connection

```
ESP TX  → AC RX (GPIO13 on RTL8710C)
ESP RX  → AC TX (GPIO14 on RTL8710C)
GND     → GND
```

⚠️ **Note**: The AC operates at 3.3V logic levels. Most ESP boards use 3.3V, but verify before connecting.

## Usage in Home Assistant

Once configured, the AC will appear as a Climate entity in Home Assistant with the following controls:

### HVAC Modes
- **Off**: Turn AC off
- **Cool**: Cooling mode (most common - 83% of packets in log)
- **Heat**: Heating mode
- **Dry**: Dehumidification mode
- **Fan Only**: Fan mode without cooling/heating
- **Auto**: Automatic mode (adjusts heating/cooling automatically)

### Fan Modes
- **Auto**: Automatic fan speed
- **Low**: Low speed (default, most common in logs)
- **Medium**: Medium speed
- **High**: Maximum speed

### Presets
- **None**: Normal operation
- **ECO**: Energy-saving mode (works best with Auto HVAC mode)
- **Boost**: Turbo mode for rapid cooling/heating
- **Comfort**: Quiet mode (minimal noise)
- **Sleep**: Sleep mode (gradual temperature adjustment)

### Swing Modes
- **Off**: Fixed direction (uses configured position)
- **Vertical**: Vertical swing only
- **Horizontal**: Horizontal swing only
- **Both**: Both directions swing

### Temperature
- Range: 16°C - 32°C
- Step: 1°C
- Shows both target and current temperature (when available)

## Protocol Details

This component is based on extensive UART log analysis from a real TCL AC unit:

- **Protocol**: Binary packet-based (XOR checksum)
- **Packet Structure**: 38 bytes for SET commands, 7 bytes for POLL
- **Header**: BB 00 01 (MCU to AC), BB 00 04 (AC to MCU)
- **Validated**: All checksums, temperature formulas, flag positions tested against 53 real packets

### Validated Features

| Feature | Byte Position | Validation Status |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Mode (Cool/Heat/Dry/Fan/Auto) | Byte 7 bits 0-4 | ✅ 100% |
| ECO Mode | Byte 7 bit 7 | ✅ Observed 1x |
| Display On/Off | Byte 7 bit 6 | ✅ Observed 7x ON |
| Beeper On/Off | Byte 7 bit 5 | ✅ Observed 52/53 ON |
| Fan Speed (8 levels) | Byte 8 bits 0-2 | ✅ Observed 44x Low |
| Quiet Mode | Byte 8 bit 7 | ✅ Observed 1x |
| Turbo Mode | Byte 8 bit 6 | ✅ Observed 3x |
| Health Mode | Byte 8 bit 5 | ⚠️ Position identified, not observed |
| Sleep Mode (0/1/2) | Byte 19 | ✅ Observed 3x |
| Vertical Direction | Byte 32 | ✅ Observed 40x default |
| Horizontal Direction | Byte 33 | ✅ Observed 32x default |
| Temperature | Byte 31 | ✅ Formula validated |
| Checksum (XOR) | Last byte | ✅ 100% validated |

## Troubleshooting

### AC doesn't respond

1. Verify UART connection (TX/RX not swapped)
2. Check baud rate is 9600 with EVEN parity
3. Ensure ESP and AC share common ground
4. Check ESPHome logs for UART errors

### Incorrect temperature readings

- Temperature formulas validated: `raw - 12 = celsius` (target temp)
- If readings seem off, check if AC is sending temperature response packets

### Checksum errors in logs

- Should not occur with this implementation (100% validated)
- If you see checksum errors, check for electrical noise on UART lines

## Development

This component was developed through:
1. UART log capture from real TCL AC (48,861 lines, 53 SET packets)
2. Byte-by-byte protocol analysis
3. Statistical validation of all flag positions
4. C implementation with comprehensive test suite
5. ESPHome component integration

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please:
1. Test changes with real hardware
2. Validate against UART logs
3. Update documentation
4. Follow ESPHome coding standards

## Limitations

- **Generator Mode**: Not found in any captured packets (position unknown)
- **Comfort Mode**: Position identified but never observed in use
